# Search-Me---Versions
 This code searches a given directory for a certain file type and puts it in another directory of your choice 

The code was created with the intention to make looking for file types from external drives easier because it allows the user to copy and paste it easily with several clicks and all in one UI

The py code can be found in SearchMe version 2.

I created some exe to run if you don't have python installed on a computer, However, they are not digitally signed, so BE WARNED, windows might think its a virus, but it's not I Promise :)
